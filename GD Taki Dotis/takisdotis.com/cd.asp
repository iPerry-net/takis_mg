						<p class="txtTitle">Taki and the Mad Greeks</p>
					<div align="left">
						<p>The legendary Takis Dotis, composer and recording artist, first appeared with Greek classical composers Vassilis Tsitsanis and Yiannis Papaioanou.</p>
						<p>In Greece, the Boozooki or an instrument very similar to it, was played long before Rembetika was developed.  In the National Historical Museam of Greece you can see Boozookis owned by the hero of the War of Independence, General Makriyianni.</p>
						<p>Demetrios ‘Takis’ Dotis is one of the true masters of this instrument.  To play the Bouzouki is hard enough in its own right, but to truly understand it, and create its voice, is the work of a rare talent.</p>
						<p>Dotis was born in Florina, Greece and developed his passion for music by the age of fourteen while working as a bus boy at the many different nightclubs of Thessaloniki. By twenty-one he had mastered the instrument he loved and historically is known as the first professional Bouzouki musician from Florina.</p>
						<p>He is also the first of his generation to perform with the legendary Rembetis at the historical nightclub Harama. Dotis played there with the musicians he had idolized as a teenager. Tsitsanis, Papaioanou, Lafkas, Zagereos and special guest appearances by Kazantzides performing with legendary singers Rita Sakelario and Beba Blanch. People can still see Takis via satellite Greek TV.  He performed in Greek movies before coming to North America.</p>
						<p>Takis was invited to appear in many famous night clubs in North America from Hollywood, San Francisco, Boston, Toronto, Houston, Dallas, Hawaii, and finally Seattle which became his permanent home after marrying a third generation local American-Greek Seattlite. Dotis built several popular Greek restaurants in Seattle such as Takis Pizza and Pasta, Takis II, and <a href="http://www.takismadgreek.com/" target="_blank">Takis Mad Greek</a>. </p>
						<p>Although the musician’s Kafenio (Cafe) in Athens no longer exists, that is where Takis would jam with rembetes Stratos Payioumtzis, Lucas Dalaras, Vassilis Tsitsani’s and Manolis Angelopoulous. One can still be a part of these remarkable musicians and composers through the training and legacy they left to Takis Dotis. </p>
