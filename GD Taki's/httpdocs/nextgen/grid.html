                <p>With Great Pleasure Taki (Demetrios) Dotis is a legendary musician, composer, recording artist and a master of the Bouzouki. After doing recordings in Athens, he played in several movies and Athenian clubs, including the historical HARAMA.</p>

                <p>Taki played with famous rembetika musicians and composers including Tsitsanis, Papaioanou, Zagoreos and Lafkas. He also accompanied such famous singers as Mitropanos, Florinotis (Euro-Vision, 1975), Rita Sakelario, and Haroula Lambraki. He is historically known as the first Bouzouki musician from Florina. Invited to perform for Greek - American audiences, his music led him to Hollywood, San Francisco, Dallas, Houston, Hawaii, Boston, Toronto, and then to Seattle.</p>

                <p>After many years of touring, he decided to make Seattle his permanent home and married Vickie "Kiki" Panagiotopoulos, a third generation American-Greek. They have two sons, Elias and George.</p>

                <p>This is the fifth Greek restaurant Taki and Kiki have built in their 25-year partnership. Taki is a distinguished chef who prepares all the food with meticulous care. The menu is full of traditional Athenian style food from fresh ingredients of the highest quality, and combines elements of northern and southern Greek cuisine. The souvlaki meats are all cut and marinated in the restaurant, and even the dip appetizers and spanakopita are prepared from scratch.</p>

                <p>Taki and Kiki have been serving excellent Greek food in Ballard for the last 20 years. Before Taki's Mad Greek they owned Taki's Pizza and Pasta (Greco-Roma Cuisine) in Ballard and downtown Seattle where they sold Greek style pizza, souvlaki, and pasta. In 2001 they built a new Greek restaurant to retire to where their entire family can be together and sold their other restaurants.</p>
