						<p class="review">This place is wild on Saturday nights. 
						Excellent food, more than my husband and I could eat. 
						The service was friendly and fast, the music out of this 
						world. These people really make you feel like one of the 
						family; I don&#39;t know how they managed it (I&#39;m putting 
						the blame squarely on the good wine!) but they got my 
						husband and I up to dance and taught us the steps. It 
						was a real blast, I would totally recommend it to my 
						friends and am definitely going back again. You should 
						give it a try!</p>

						<p class="review">The food at Taki&#39;s mad greek is fresh 
						and outrageously delicous!</p>
						<p class="review">It&#39;s a good place to stop for a 
						gratifying, healthy lunch.</p>
						<p class="review">The lunch special is cheap and really 
						tasty. It&#39;s a good bargain because you are getting 
						incredible food in a nice, family-run restaurant.</p>
						<p class="review">I love the atmosphere because the 
						walls are covered with family photos and colorful murals 
						of Greece. &nbsp;It feels very amicable and fun.</p>
						<p class="review">It&#39;s like eating a carefully prepared Greek meal at your 
						good friend&#39;s house.</p>
						<p class="review">It&#39;s not pretentious, flashy or fussy. 
						It&#39;s simply quality food served by good people.</p>
						<p class="review">Taki and his wife Kiki are welcoming 
						and very friendly. It&#39;s very rare for the owner of a 
						restaurant to converse with the customers. However, I&#39;ve 
						had both Taki and Kiki make friendly conversation with 
						me. Not only is Taki an excellent cook, but he is also 
						an amazing musician.</p>
						<p class="review">They have live entertainment (Taki on 
						the Bouzouki and Baglama and &nbsp;the Mad Greeks and Belly 
						Dancing) on Saturdays, which you must have a reservation 
						for because this place fills up quickly! &nbsp;I&#39;m happy I 
						discovered this place and I will keep going back.</p>
						<p class="review">I often stop in for lunch after 
						shopping at Value Village. They are located next door to 
						a Scandanavian bakery and The Tweetery&#39;s new location.</p>
						<p class="review">This is another diamond in the rough. 
						I highly suggest this restaurant!</p>

						<p class="review">Just went to Taki&#39;s tonight and it was 
						delicious. He is a freakin&#39; master on the grill. His 
						lamb is the best I&#39;ve had and being Greek, I&#39;ve had a 
						lot in my time. Him and his wife Kiki run the place and 
						are very sweet.</p>
									<p class="review">She takes care of the 
									front of the house while he expertly handles 
									the back. Taki is also a world class 
									bouzouki player and they have Greek music 
									there on Saturday nights. It&#39;s a great 
									neighborhood joint and every time I go, I 
									decide that I need to visit it more.</p>

						<p class="review">Hands down one of the most memorable 
						nights in recent years.</p>
						<p class="review">A visit to Taki&#39;s is worth it just for 
						his Bouzouki (Greek Guitar) skills!&nbsp;Consider yourself 
						lucky to arrive on a rainy Saturday for this treat--then 
						be prepared to sit and sit and sit for hours feasting 
						and really being part of a PARTY!</p>
						<p class="review">Order up the Saganaki (flaming 
						cheese--not gay--but seriously... lit on fire).&nbsp;I have 
						had this appetizer all over the country and Taki does it 
						best.</p>
						<p class="review">Then get down with their basic Mad 
						Greek Special -- a huge skewer each of three various 
						seasoned meats (I chose two chicken and one 
						steak).&nbsp;Sounds basic? &nbsp;Bullshit. Taki &amp; Company season 
						this meat to perfection--you will dream about this plate 
						in a year from consumption--like I am doing right now.</p>
						<p class="review">Belly Dancing.&nbsp;Hopefully you get to 
						see the beautiful Lisa Yasmeen perform. Amazing 
						talent.&nbsp;The entire restaurant gets going and you lose 
						track of time...........like Marty McFly in the Twin 
						Pines Mall Parking Lot.</p>

						<p class="review">The food is always great. The owner&#39;s 
						wife is so friendly. She always remembered me when I 
						came in frequently, and sometimes would give me a 
						complimentary baklava and talk with me. &nbsp;When I came in 
						with friends, I was always encouraged to sit down and 
						have water or coffee while we waited for our food. I 
						love the gyros and the falafel sandwich. &nbsp;Everything is 
						always fresh and full of flavor.</p>

						<p class="review">The lamb was cooked perfectly to order

						Kerkyra (Corfu), my &quot;old country&quot;.</p>
						<p class="review">Kiki &amp; Taki were wonderful to meet. 
						&nbsp;Whether you&#39;ve ever been to Greece, or just love 
						flavors of the Mediterranean, make sure not to miss 
						Taki&#39;s. &nbsp;It has humble decor, but is rich with true 
						Greek cooking and culture.</p>
